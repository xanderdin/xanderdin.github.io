      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is too fast running out of my head the memories of things I was investing
my time and efforts into. So, after glancing on the history of my
pull requests I decided to make a short report on them for the future
remembrance. Most of the things described here are already merged into main
&lt;a href=&#34;https://librecad.org&#34;&gt;LibreCAD&lt;/a&gt; branch, but some (at the moment of writing of this article) are
still remaining as &amp;ldquo;Open&amp;rdquo; pull requests. Hope, they too would be merged soon.
And here is the list of what I have done in the past few
months to the benefits of &lt;a href=&#34;https://librecad.org&#34;&gt;LibreCAD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>As I related in my previous article, I got a sudden urge to automate my process of preparation of drawings. Automatic enumeration &amp;ndash; perfect, but now I need to prepare those sheets for printing somehow.
These days my main tool for drawing is LibreCAD. When I was choosing it, one of the criterias among others was certainly its freeness and open sources. And at this time the advantage of open source was shown in its full strength.</description>

      <description>Olga, my wife is a professional artist and an interior designer. She&amp;rsquo;s using brushes, paints and pencils in a perfect way. But when it comes to a computer the matters become a little bit worse. Nevertheless, she mastered a couple of graphical applications and even such a big &amp;ldquo;monster&amp;rdquo; for 3D modeling as Blender!
But for the interior design neighther drawing a picture nor even building a 3D model is quite enough.</description>
