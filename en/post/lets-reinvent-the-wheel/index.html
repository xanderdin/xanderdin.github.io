<p>Olga, my wife is a professional artist and an interior designer.
She&rsquo;s using brushes, paints and pencils in a perfect way. But when it
comes to a computer the matters become a little bit worse. Nevertheless,
she mastered a couple of graphical applications and even such a big &ldquo;monster&rdquo;
for 3D modeling as <a href="https://www.blender.org">Blender</a>!</p>

<p><img src="/img/post/2018111701/1.jpg" alt="Design example" /></p>

<p>But for the interior design neighther drawing a picture nor even building a 3D
model is quite enough. Builders require technical drawings. But my wife
is having much troubles when it comes to CAD applications. So, she was drawing
technical drawings with a regular pencil on regular paper sheets.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I lost my job and was having strong professional burnout that kept
me in troubles when I was trying to find another one. I felt like changing
my profession is what I really needed. At that time we decided that
I would try to take a part in my wife&rsquo;s designing job and start drawing
technical drawings.</p>

<p>No sooner said than done. Step by step, I started doing that new for me
occupation. Being an old fan of free open source software, there&rsquo;s no wonder
why I started using exactly that software and in this field. By the way, one
of the main tools I&rsquo;m using in this field is <a href="https://librecad.org">LibreCAD</a>.
One, second project, yet another&hellip; Gradually, the full picture started to
become visible and the clear understanding of how to organize my workflow.
Appeared my own templates, my components for drawings in my library became
growing in number.</p>

<p><img src="/img/post/2018111701/2.jpg" alt="Drawing example" /></p>

<p>At some point I realized that there are a lot of repetitive manual work which
were stealing a lot of time, and that it is to be automated. And then I felt
like now was the time to apply my former professional knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="the-wheel-named-enumsheets-https-github-com-xanderdin-enumsheets">The &ldquo;wheel&rdquo; named <a href="https://github.com/xanderdin/enumsheets">enumsheets</a></h2>

<p>One of the final stages of making drawings is numbering the sheets, counting
the total number of sheets and making the contents. The matter is when
initially drawing those sheets the final number of them is yet unknown.
Also the final numbers may change by adding/removing sheets or
by changing their ordering. When those numbers are already known, each
sheet must be opened once again and those numbers must be inserted to its title
block fields. Also you have to copy each sheet title to your contents
page. A usual design project consists of 50-60 drawings sheets. Opening
each of them and setting those values requires a couple of hours of boring
manual work. Imagine now if a mistake was made somewhere in the beginning or
middle of those sheets! Or if again you need to add or remove or reorder
them. Why should we do all that manual job if we have computers?!</p>

<p>That was the reason why <a href="https://github.com/xanderdin/enumsheets">enumsheets</a>
was made. The script counts the total number of sheets, searches for title
block in each of them, updates required values including sheet number, total
number of sheets, and optionally sets date, scale and address. Also the script
extracts the titles of each sheet and saves them as contents in an Excel file.
And all that in seconds.</p>

<p><img src="/img/post/2018111701/3.jpg" alt="Unprocessed title block" /></p>

<p><img src="/img/post/2018111701/4.jpg" alt="Processed title block" /></p>

<p>The script is mainly targeted to our process of preparing drawings as it&rsquo;s
required for my wife&rsquo;s design work (<a href="http://artidea.gallery">http://artidea.gallery</a>). But as far as
all main parameters of the script are configurable it could be adjusted and
for needs of someone else. Hope, it would ease someone&rsquo;s job also.</p>

<h2 id="so-sheets-are-ready-what-else">So, sheets are ready, what else?</h2>

<p>Sure, there are yet many things require automation. For example, when all
sheets are prepared, they still are stored each in its own dxf file. But we
also need to prepare them to printing. In our case we need one big pdf file
with all the sheets in it. And what, should we again open each sheet and print
it to a single pdf file? Sure not, although initially that was so. And I&rsquo;m
going to tell how I automated that stage in my next article. But for now,
I wish you good luck in reinventing your own &ldquo;wheels&rdquo; :) !</p>
