<p>As I related in my <a href="/en/post/lets-reinvent-the-wheel">previous article</a>, I got
a sudden urge to automate my process of preparation of drawings.
Automatic enumeration &ndash; perfect, but now I need to prepare those
sheets for printing somehow.</p>

<p>These days my main tool for drawing is
<a href="https://librecad.org">LibreCAD</a>. When I was choosing it, one of the criterias
among others was certainly its freeness and open sources. And at this time
the advantage of open source was shown in its full strength.</p>

<p><img src="/img/post/2018112001/1.png" alt="My drawing in LibreCAD" /></p>

<p>So, as a final result I need one single <em>pdf</em> file with all sheets in it.
I was accomplishing that by the following. With each sheet, I opened it in
<em>LibreCAD</em>, then I was switching to print preview mode, next I was setting
printing scale, and the sheet was centered. After that I was printing it to
a <em>pdf</em> file each time giving new name for the output file. When all
sheets were so converted to their <em>pdf</em> files, I was running in my system
(<a href="https://debian.org">Debian</a>) a console utility
<a href="https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/poppler-utils/pdfunite.1.en.html">pdfunite</a>
and was getting all those <em>pdf</em> files united into single <em>pdf</em> file.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy enough to imagine that procedure required also a lot of
repetitive manual actions and was taking a lot of time. You may think, why
not doing all that right after drawing a sheet? The answer is simple, I need
numbering of each sheet and insertion of total number of sheets into every sheet
title block, but the total number of sheets is unknown until all sheets are
drawn.</p>

<p>I needed a solution, a utility which I would run in console, with directory
as a command line parameter, where all my <em>dxf</em> files were saved, and would
get as output many, or even better, one <em>pdf</em> file.</p>

<p>I searched for such utilities and didn&rsquo;t find anything suitable.
Realising, if <em>LibreCAD</em> can print required <em>pdf</em>, so why not to use its
functionality somehow. Realising also, if I would put a <em>feature request</em> to
<em>LibreCAD</em> developers, it would most probably required too much time, as far as
they have enough tasks to work upon without it. And this is what
the real power of open source software is &ndash; if you can, go roll up your
sleeves and just do it yourself, and don&rsquo;t forget to share with others either.
At that time I decided to try and write such a utility myself. Inspired by
the future results I started digging into <em>LibreCAD</em> source code.</p>

<h2 id="warming-up">Warming-up</h2>

<p>I have little knowledge of <em>C++</em> or <a href="https://www.qt.io">Qt</a> with which the
<em>LibreCAD</em> is written, but I got some experience of programming in <em>C</em> and also
some experience in object oriented programing using <em>Java</em> and <em>Python</em>.
So digging into <em>LibreCAD</em>&rsquo;s source code didn&rsquo;t discovered any big troubles.</p>

<p>But before coding something more complicated I decided to test my skills
with something more simple. Because of using many layers in my drawings
I was feeling strong shortage of the ability to lock/unlock all layers at once.
Just imagine, you need unlocking of 150-200 layers and you&rsquo;re doing that
one by one. Every time I was clicking on a small image of a lock of next
layer I was feeling it was rather strange not having such a functionality,
given that similar functionality for showing/hiding all layers was implemented.
And I decided to implement that similar feature.</p>

<p>By using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/">grep</a> I searched for
the roots of &lsquo;Show/Hide all layers&rsquo; functionality and wrote the similar one.
My
<a href="https://github.com/LibreCAD/LibreCAD/pull/1018">pull request</a> got merged
into <em>LibreCAD</em> <strong>master</strong> branch unexpectedly quickly, which gave me more
inspiration for implementation of my former intention.</p>

<p><img src="/img/post/2018112001/2.png" alt="Lock/Unlock all layers buttons" /></p>

<h2 id="dxf2pdf">dxf2pdf</h2>

<p>So, inspired I began implementation. Initially I wanted to make a stand alone
utility something similar like <em>ttf2lff</em> in <em>LibreCAD</em>, using only minimal
subset of required code from <em>LibreCAD</em> and not touching any code on which
<em>librecad</em> itself was build. I was searching methods for printing to <em>pdf</em>,
copying them and unsparingly cutting off everything I thought was redundant
for the future utility and soon got working prototype.
However, the produced <em>pdf</em> files were somewhat a little bit different of what
I usually was getting when printing from <em>LibreCAD</em>. And they lacked hatches and
fonts completely.</p>

<p>After more thorough digging in the code I realized the functionality for
<em>pdf</em> printing had a lot more dependencies on other <em>LibreCAD</em> code than
I was thinking initially. Suspecting if I would copy more code then it would
required synchronizing with each additions/fixes in the <em>LibreCAD</em> code.
So, that approach was rejected.</p>

<p>Next, I wanted to use the full set of <em>LibreCAD</em> code only replacing
<strong>main()</strong> function, from which the <em>LibreCAD</em> would run not as a graphical
application, but as a console one, would print and would stop running. That
approach appeared quite working, but after all that I got two binary files &ndash;
<em>librecad</em> and <em>dxf2pdf</em>, both almost equal in size, and also some
complications with the building process of both two <strong>main()</strong> functions.
Considered such an approach somewhat weird and rejected it also, deciding
finally to make a small injection of my code into <em>LibreCAD</em> itself.</p>

<p><img src="/img/post/2018112001/3.png" alt="My code injection to LibreCAD" /></p>

<p>Thus I added to the command line parameters list the <em>dxf2pdf</em> subcommand.
If specified, <em>LibreCAD</em> would run in console mode and would print chosen
<em>dxf</em> files to corresponding set or single <em>pdf</em> file.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as it turned out later, because of some specialties of
<em>Qt</em> when running on <em>Windows</em>, unlike on <em>Linux</em>, there is something
preventing printing in <em>Windows</em> resulting in no output at all. I&rsquo;m
not using <em>Windows</em>, so I don&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>

<p>At this time <em>dxf2pdf</em> could be run with the following parameters:</p>

<pre><code>dxf2pdf usage: librecad dxf2pdf [options] &lt;dxf_files&gt;

Print a bunch of DXF files to PDF file(s).

Examples:

  librecad dxf2pdf *.dxf    -- print all dxf files to pdf files with the same names.

  librecad dxf2pdf -o some.pdf *.dxf    -- print all dxf files to 'some.pdf' file.

Options:
  -h, --help                  Displays this help.
  -v, --version               Displays version information.
  -a, --fit                   Auto fit and center drawing to page.
  -c, --center                Auto center drawing on page.
  -k, --grayscale             Print grayscale.
  -m, --monochrome            Print monochrome (black/white).
  -p, --paper &lt;WxH&gt;           Paper size (Width x Height) in mm.
  -r, --resolution &lt;integer&gt;  Output resolution (DPI).
  -s, --scale &lt;double&gt;        Output scale. E.g.: 0.01 (for 1:100 scale).
  -o, --outfile &lt;file&gt;        Output PDF file.
  -t, --directory &lt;path&gt;      Target output directory.

Arguments:
  &lt;dxf_files&gt;                 Input DXF file(s)

</code></pre>

<p>You can also create a link to <em>librecad</em> binary and name it <em>dxf2pdf</em>:</p>

<pre><code>ln -s librecad dxf2pdf
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can run the command right away like this:</p>

<pre><code>dxf2pdf -o some.pdf *.dxf
</code></pre>

<p>Certainly after creating such a tool I wanted to share it with the project
on which it has strong dependency. This time, after making a
<a href="https://github.com/LibreCAD/LibreCAD/pull/1023">pull request</a>
my waiting was much longer. With every new day I felt like my code was
too bad and would be rejected. But no, after about a week my code was
merged. Hurray, now I don&rsquo;t have to print each of about half of a hundred <em>dxf</em>
files to <em>pdf</em> manually during hours, everything&rsquo;s done in a few seconds
by a single press of the [Enter] key!</p>
