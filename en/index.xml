      <description>Olga, my wife is a professional artist and an interior designer. She&amp;rsquo;s using brushes, paints and pencils in a perfect way. But when it comes to a computer the matters become a little bit worse. Nevertheless, she mastered a couple of graphical applications and even such a big &amp;ldquo;monster&amp;rdquo; for 3D modeling as Blender!
But for the interior design neighther drawing a picture nor even building a 3D model is quite enough.</description>

      <description>I ordered a Jiayu G2F WCDMA phone with 1Gb RAM and 4Gb ROM at Aliexpress. The phone is pretty cool but it has a very disappointing problem - it freezes very often without any visible reason. Searching on the web revealed that this problem pertains to the whole model and not exclusively to my device. I purchased the phone for my daughter and she liked it very much, so we didn&amp;rsquo;t want sending it back to seller.</description>
